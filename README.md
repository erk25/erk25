Young Developer of Front-End! <br> 

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a young tech enthusiast and passionate about website development.<br>
My name is Erik, a Computer Technician and Systems Analyst and Developer.<br>
From an early age, I had a natural interest in technology and its constant advancement.<br>
Iâ€™ve always been curious about how things work behind screens and how we can create amazing experiences for users.<br> 
Over the years,  Iâ€™ve been honing my skills in front-end development, focusing on website and application development.<br>
